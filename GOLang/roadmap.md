# Project Roadmap: eBay Listings Reference Tool

## Introduction
This roadmap outlines the steps to develop the eBay Listings Reference Tool—a lightweight Windows application for shipping staff to quickly look up item titles and descriptions from public eBay listings. The goal is to improve shipping speed, reduce errors, and eliminate unnecessary interruptions.

## Roadmap Steps

1. **Create a Mockup of the Windows App**
   - Design initial UI/UX sketches for the main application window and dashboard.
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders or shipping staff.

2. **Build the Dashboard**
   - Implement the dashboard interface for searching and viewing listings.
   - Add search, filter, and detailed view features.

3. **eBay Data Collection**
   - Research eBay’s public listing APIs or scraping methods.
   - Implement a module to fetch listing data (titles, descriptions, etc.).
   - Parse and store required fields locally.

4. **Local Database Design**
   - Choose a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite, JSON, etc.).
   - Design schema to store listing data efficiently.
   - Implement database read/write operations.

5. **Core Application Logic**
   - Build backend logic for searching, filtering, and retrieving listings.
   - Implement scheduled and manual database refresh.
   - Add error handling and logging.

6. **Packaging & Distribution**
   - Bundle the application for easy installation (e.g., as an .exe).
   - Write installation instructions.

7. **Testing & QA**
   - Test data collection, search, and UI features.
   - Gather feedback from shipping staff or test users.
   - Fix bugs and refine usability.

8. **Documentation & Support**
   - Expand README with troubleshooting, FAQ, and support contacts.
   - Prepare user guides or quick-start materials.

9. **Maintenance & Updates**
   - Set up a process for periodic updates (e.g., scheduled DB refresh).
   - Plan for future improvements (feature requests, optimizations).
