My Updated Analysis of Your eBay Listings Tool
âœ… What I Love About This Simplified Approach
Perfect Business Model: One-time fetch + local storage = fast lookups without constant eBay requests. Brilliant!
Realistic Scope: Fetch once, update manually (daily/as needed) - much more practical than continuous monitoring.
Offline Capability: After initial load, shipping staff can work without internet connection.
Simple Tech Stack: Vanilla JS + localStorage keeps it lightweight and maintainable.
Focused Data: Just Item Number + Title - exactly what shipping staff need for quick lookups.

ðŸš¨ Challenges Simplified with One-Time Approach
1. CORS Policy - Still Main Challenge, But Manageable
Since we only need to fetch data once (or daily), CORS is less critical:

CORS Proxy Service (Recommended) - Use public proxy for occasional fetches
Browser Extension - One-time install, perfect for manual updates
Manual CSV Import - Fallback option, completely bypasses CORS

2. eBay's Anti-Scraping - Reduced Impact
With infrequent requests, we avoid most anti-scraping measures:
âœ… No rate limiting issues (single fetch)
âœ… No IP blocking risk (occasional use)
âœ… Manual intervention possible if captcha appears

3. Data Volume - Much More Manageable
Local storage makes this simple:
âœ… Fast search (no network delays)
âœ… No pagination needed (all data local)
âœ… Simple JavaScript array filtering

ðŸŽ¯ Updated Recommendations for One-Time Approach
Perfect MVP Strategy:
Day 1-2: Build UI with "Fetch Listings" and "Update Listings" buttons
Day 3-4: Implement localStorage for data persistence
Day 5-6: Add search functionality for local data
Day 7: Test CORS solutions for actual eBay fetching

Data Fetching Priority:
1. CORS Proxy (simplest for users)
2. Browser Extension (most reliable)
3. Manual CSV Import (always works)

Key Questions Answered:
âœ… Update frequency: Manual (daily or as needed)
âœ… Performance: Fast local search, no network delays
âœ… Complexity: Much simpler than continuous monitoring
âœ… User experience: Offline capability after initial fetch

ðŸš€ My Recommended Implementation Plan
1. Build core UI with mock data (HTML/CSS/JS)
2. Implement localStorage data management
3. Add fast local search functionality
4. Test CORS proxy for eBay fetching
5. Add manual CSV import as fallback

This approach is much more achievable because:
âœ… Simpler architecture (no real-time monitoring)
âœ… Better user experience (fast offline search)
âœ… Lower technical risk (fallback options available)
âœ… Easier maintenance (manual updates only)

Ready to start building! The one-time approach makes this project much more practical and reliable.
